# URL shortener

We need to make some money! It's time to start our own internet business.
Let's build a URL Shortener. We will make a web application where we can add new urls and we will be assigned a shortened version. Then if we visit that shortened version we will be redirected to the url provided.
For example, if the appropriate data is in place if you type in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/345

```
your should be redirected to
```
http://ohmyweekpage.com/something

```
We should also have another page with a list of all url in the system and we should show when it was created and the number of times it was visited.
```
http://ohmyweekpage.com/something - created on 25-12-2015 - visited 24 times
http://www.google.com - created on 26-12-2015 - visited 4 times
```
